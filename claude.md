# This project is a multiplayer video game being built with Phaser + Javascript. The goal is to eventually deploy it to mobile and desktop using React Native and Electron respectively. The game supports anywhere from 1 to 4 players that will play against an AI. All game states need to be synced amongst all players, and designed in a way to prevent cheating.

# Any requests sent to claude are expected to be fully implemented using best-practices. If something is mentioned to be broken, but it is present in code you must assume the user is correct in that the existing implementation isn't working as expected. Use a first-principles approach to deeply understanding why something is broken before fixing it. Always break tasks into subtasks and track progress appropriately in todo.md.
