1. High-Level Description
Genre & Theme

2D rogue-style autobattler with dungeon-crawling elements.

Cooperative multiplayer (1–4 players) vs. NPC/AI enemies.

Procedurally-progressing floors (10 total); clearing Floor 10 wins the match.

Core Objectives

Between floors, players spend gold to place purchasable “Units” on a shared grid.

Combat phase: all placed Units auto-attack, move, and resolve battle without direct player input.

Economy: earn gold from kills; spend gold to buy new Units, reroll upgrade options, or sell existing Units.

Upgrade system: after each floor, players choose from randomized upgrade cards that modify unit behavior.

Win/Lose Conditions

Win: All 10 floors cleared (floor 1 → 10).

Lose: All player-owned Units die on any floor (i.e., no surviving Units at end of combat).

2. Platforms & Technology Stack

Front-End

Framework: React Native

Game Engine: Phaser integrated into React Native (e.g., via react-phaser)

UI Layer: React Native components for menus, lobby, upgrade selection, and game stats.

Back-End

Runtime: Node.js

Multiplayer Networking: WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) or PlayFab integration for matchmaking/state sync.

Hosting: Google Cloud Platform with CloudSQL solution for datastore. Come up with best practice and quick method for authentication and account data persistence.

Build & Deployment

Mobile Platforms: Android and iOS via Expo or React Native CLI.

Desktop (optional): Electron wrapper or deploy to Steam via an HTML5 wrapper.

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions → Build → Deploy backend to GCP → Publish mobile builds to app stores.

3. Core Game Loop
Lobby & Unit Selection

Upon match start, each player joins a lobby.

All players begin with 50 gold.

No pre-selected Heroes—only Units purchased during gameplay.

Floor Sequence (for Floors 1 through 10)

Preparation Phase

Gold carries over from previous floor.

Players use gold to:

Purchase Units from the shop.

Sell existing Units at 75% refund of their cost.

Reroll upgrade cards (10 gold per reroll).

Shop dynamically offers Units based on floor progression.

Players place purchased Units onto the shared grid (grid size scales per floor).

Combat Phase

Units auto-path toward the enemy side.

Auto-attacks occur when enemies come within a Unit’s range.

Combat resolves until one side is eliminated.

If all player Units die → match ends in defeat.

Surviving Units persist to the next floor; dead Units are removed.

Players earn gold:

When any player’s Unit lands the killing blow on an enemy, all players receive ceil(UnitCost × 0.25) gold.

Post-Combat Phase

Distribute gold bounties from kills.

Present 4 random upgrade cards to the winning team (if they survived):

1 High-Potency upgrade (×3 effectiveness) applies to a random Unit type the players currently own.

3 Normal-Potency upgrades; players choose which Unit type to apply them to.

Players may spend gold (10 each) to reroll these upgrade choices.

Proceed to next floor if any Units remain; otherwise, match over.

Match Completion

If players clear Floor 10, they win.

If all Units die on any floor, they lose immediately.

4. Economy & Progression
Starting Conditions

All players start with 50 gold on Floor 1.

No pre-owned Units; everything must be purchased.

Gold Income

Kill Bounty: When a player’s Unit kills an enemy, all players gain ceil(UnitCost × 0.25) gold.

Floor Completion: Surviving Units persist—no extra bonus beyond their kill income.

Sell Value: Any Unit can be sold at any time for 75% of its original cost.

Shop & Upgrades

Shop Refresh: Each floor, the shop’s available Units scale with Floor × 25 budget (see AI spawn logic for reference).

Upgrade Cards:

Draw 4 per cleared floor (1 high-potency, 3 normal).

Reroll upgrade pool for 10 gold each.

Upgrades directly buff one Unit type (chosen by player for normals; randomly assigned for high-potency).

6. Upgrade System
Upgrade Tiers

High-Potency (×3 Effect):
• Assigned automatically to a random Unit type the players own.

Normal-Potency:
• Players choose which owned Unit type receives the bonus.

Example Upgrades (flat % or flat value)

10% Damage dealt is restored as health

20% Increased Movement Speed

10% Increased Health

10% Increased Damage

10% Increased Attack Speed

+1 Priority (less likely to be targeted)

–1 Priority (more likely to be targeted)

Gain Passive: Heal nearby Units for 25% of this Unit’s max health on death

Gain Passive: Explode on death, dealing 20% of this Unit’s max health as damage to nearby enemies

Gain Passive: Poison damaged enemies, causing 1 HP/sec

Gain Passive: Slow nearby enemies, decreasing their attack speed by 10%

Reroll Mechanics

Each reroll costs 10 gold, only available for the upgrades after clearing battle phase floor.

Reroll reshuffles the four current options.

7. AI Spawn Logic & Counterplay
Weight Aggregation

Each player’s placed Units have weightings for Aggro, Midrange, and Control.

AI sums all players’ weightings for each archetype:

e.g., if Player 1’s Units total (Aggro 200, Midrange 150, Control 50) and Player 2’s Units total (Aggro 100, Midrange 200, Control 100), then combined = (Aggro 300, Midrange 350, Control 150).

The highest combined weighting determines the “dominant archetype” that AI will counter.

Counter-Spawning

AI’s total spawn budget =

targetBudget = (Floor × 25) + (TotalCostOfAllPlayerUnits × 0.60)
spawnBudget ≈ ±10% of targetBudget
AI fills spawnBudget by randomly selecting Units of two types until budget is met.

AI Behavior

AI Units behave like player Units: auto‐move, auto‐attack.

AI targeting: follow same Priority logic as player Units (lower priority → targeted first).

8. Grid & Placement System
Grid Structure

Dimensions: 12 × 12 cells (adjustable by floor if desired).

Shared Grid amongst players, players see where one-another has placed units

Cell Size: Adaptable based on device resolution; ensure Units scale and snap correctly.

Placement Rules

No overlapping: one Unit per cell.

Movement/attack range ignores grid once combat starts (free movement via pathfinding).

UI / UX

Highlight Valid Cells: When dragging a Unit to place, highlight only valid placement cells.

Gold Display: Show each player’s gold total in a shared HUD.

Shop Panel: Lists available Units, cost, and small tooltip showing stats.

Sell Button: Players may sell their own placed Units for 75% of cost (refund immediately).

9. Combat & Targeting Rules
Target Selection

Each Unit picks the closest enemy within Range, filtered by lowest Priority value first.

If multiple enemies share lowest Priority, pick the physically closest.

Attack Resolution

Cooldown Timer: Each Unit has (1 / AttackSpeed) seconds between attacks.

Damage Calculation:

actualDamage = BaseDamage × ArmorMultiplier
ArmorMultiplier based on enemy’s Armor Type (see Unit Attributes).

On-Hit Effects: Apply passive procs (e.g., poison, slow).

Death & Bounty

When a Unit kills an enemy, all players gain ceil(UnitCost × 0.25) gold.

Units that die are removed from grid immediately; cannot be resurrected.

10. Networking & Synchronization
Matchmaking

Create custom matchmaking system with ability to party with 1-4 random players, or with friends

Once all players ready, server broadcasts “Start Match” with randomized floor seed.

State Sync

Turn-Based Prep Phases:

Server tracks each player’s gold, shop state, placed Units.

When all players confirm “Ready,” server transitions to Combat Phase.

Combat Phase:

Server runs a deterministic simulation (or authoritative AI) and broadcasts periodic state updates (positions, HP).

Clients render locally but rely on server ticks for authoritative resolution.

Reconciliation

Clients send only placement/sell/purchase commands during Prep Phase.

Combat is fully simulated server-side; clients receive unit-position updates 10–20×/sec.

At round end, server sends “FloorResult” message with:

Surviving Units list

Gold earned

Next shop offerings (seeded)

11. Progression Balancing & Tuning
Floor Scaling

Enemy strength and spawn budget increase each floor:

baseBudget = Floor × 25
playerContribution = TotalCostOfAllPlayerUnits × 0.60
targetBudget = baseBudget + playerContribution
spawnBudget ∈ [0.9 × targetBudget, 1.1 × targetBudget]
Unit costs should scale so early floors only offer low-tier Units; higher floors unlock higher-cost Units.

Gold Curve

Starting Gold: 50

Expected Gold per Floor:

Floor 1: ~20–30 (from shallow enemies)

Floor 10: ~200+ (tougher enemies)
