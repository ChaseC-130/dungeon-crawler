# Sprites on the Unit Selection Modal, the shop screen of your selected units, and the upgrade available panel do not match the sprites rendered in the grid cells. They are often misaligned, show multiple sprites from spritesheet, and do not loop their idle animation. The preparation phase grid sprite should be used consistently across the other interfaces

# When a player hovers over a cell, other players should see their color hovering over the cell. Currently, there is only a green cell highlighted randomly.

# The game is not properly returning to the grid/preparation phase style background follow the battle end. 

# Players should be able to drag their own units on the grid and drop them in other cells to move them
