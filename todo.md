# The upgrade panel isn't working. When a player toggles and upgrade then presses "Select Upgrade" it simply re-renders the upgrade panel. It doesn't close, it doesn't grant the player the upgrade, and the upgrade available button doesn't dissapear as it should.

# The wizards' attack projectile isn't working. They should have a distinct projectile (Use anything necessary, such as a simple blue circle using Phaser capabilities) or preferably Charge_1_X.png from assets\units\wizard\wizard.json

# There is no animation or indication currently present to players' client when they are moving a unit from grid cell to another grid cell. We should "Pick up" the unit sprite to indicate to the player they are moving when they click + drag. There may be an implementation in code already, but it's not working.
