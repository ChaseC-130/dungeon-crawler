We need to rewrite all the UI elements of the game to look more like a game. Use context7 to analyze the Phaser3 library.


Re-analyze and re-implement as necessary all the menus, buttons, icons, unit cards, background, rendering as according to best practices for Phaser3 to make a sleek, nice looking game. Make sure it's formatting cleanly for desktop and future react-native mobile use. Ensure all dragging, presses, and player interactions with tooltips and clickables have some visual feedback.

Let's no longer use the existing background image assets used and let's implement a generic soft background that would be seen commonly in Phaser 3 games.
Ensure that unit behavior, collision, fighting, death, and respective animations and functionalities are fully implemented and work as intended.

Implement a game over screen with scores with a flow to bring users back to the main menu.

Flesh out some of the existing flows, such as right now the same client can queue multiple times in the same lobby by spamming "Find Match" - This should be limited to one per player/user.
